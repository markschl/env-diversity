#### Software options ####

# For QIIME, it is possible to configure the exact version
# (must be installed in a Conda environment with the given name)
qiime:
  version: qiime2-2022.8


#### Input files ####

input:
  # Lists of directories and/or glob patterns can be specified.
  # It is no problem if some files are matched by both, they will only 
  # be included once.
  # However, multiple files with the same name in different directories are 
  # currently pooled together before processing. Which files were chosen
  # and which ones were pooled is listed in 'results/samples.yaml' after
  # running the 'config' or other commands.
  directories:
    - test/gz
  patterns:
    - path/to/other/files/**/Abc*.gz
  # recursive: true causes directories to be searched recursively, and
  # glob patterns can contain /**/ to match unknown/unlimited directory depth
  recursive: true
  # Name patterns for determining sample names: This pipeline does not
  # require any metadata file specifying sample names and corresponding input files.
  # However, it is necessary to specify the correct name pattern to obtain
  # sample names from the file names.
  # Options are:
  # - sample_read: e.g. Sample_Name_R1.fasta.gz 
  # - illumina: e.g. Sample_Name_S276_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz 
  # - regular expression with two groups, the first one matches the sample name
  #     and the second one the read number (1 = forward, 2 = reverse).
  #     For example, the sample_read pattern looks like this: 
  #     '(.+?)_R([12])\.fastq\.gz'
  #     The illumina pattern: "(.+?)_S\d+_L\d+_R([12])_\d{3}\.fastq\.gz"
  name_pattern: sample_read  # {sample_read, illumina, <regex>}


##### Pipeline definition ####

# Each pipeline needs two options:
#  cluster: name of a clustering/denoising method
#  taxonomy: either 'default' (all databases and methods listed
#    below under the 'taxonomy_dbs' and 'taxonomy_methods' options,
#    or a custom combination of database/method names
#     (see example in 'unoise_usearch' pipeline)
pipelines:
  # UNOISE3 pipeline using VSEARCH for denoising
  unoise:
    cluster: usearch_unoise3  # { usearch_unoise3, qiime_dada2, amptk_unoise3, amptk_dada2 }
    taxonomy: default  # using all taxonomy_dbs and taxonomy_methods
  # UNOISE3 pipeline using USEARCH for denoising and a custom combination
  # of taxonomy databases/assignment methods
  unoise_usearch:
    cluster: usearch_unoise3  # { usearch_unoise3, qiime_dada2, amptk_unoise3, amptk_dada2 }
    taxonomy:
      dbs:   # overrides 'taxonomy_dbs' (below)
        ITS: [unite_species]
      methods:  # overrides 'taxonomy_methods' (below)
        - sintax_90
    # Here, we choose USEARCH for denoising instead of VSEARCH.
    # The below settings simply overwrite the settings found
    # below the pipelines definition in this file. The settings
    # hierarchy needs to be exactly the same as below, best
    # check results/<pipeline>/config.yaml to see if the settings
    # override was correctly specified.
    settings:
      usearch:
        unoise: { program: usearch }
  # QIIME / DADA2
  qiime_dada2:

#### Files to compare with ASVs/OTUs using usearch_global (VSEARCH) ####

compare:
  my_comparison:
    file: path/to/seqs.fasta   # searched against denoised.fasta
    ident_threshold: 0.8  # min. identity (0 - 1)

#### Primers ####

primers:
  # Primers are grouped per marker. The marker name (in this case ITS) needs to be
  # present in the 'taxonomy_dbs' configuration. Only databases from the given
  # marker will be used for taxonomy assignments.
  # Furthermore, some marker-specific rules such as 'ITSx' will only be run with ITS sequences
  ITS:
    # Several primers can be specified. The desired combinations can be 
    # specified as well (see 'combinations' below. Multiple primer combinations
    # may occur if:
    # - Different samples were amplified with different primers
    # - Some or all samples are a mix of different amplicons, which were pooled before indexing
    # Each primer can further be a comma delimited list of oligos, which
    # were mixed together. However, they should still start at the same 
    # nucleotide position to allow global trimming. Note that some pipelines
    # cannot deal with primer mixtures, in these cases the consensus sequence of the
    # single mixed sequences is used.
    # The oligos may include adapter and/or linker sequences, but their position is not 
    # required to be at the exact sequence start or end.
    forward: 
      - ITS3-KYO2: GGGATGAAGAACGYAGYRAA
      # - fITS7: GTGARTCATCGAATCTTTG
    reverse:
      - ITS4: AATCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC,AATCCTCCGCTGAWTAATATGC
    # Primer combinations: either 'default' (to use all possible combinations), 
    #   or a list of combinations (see below)
    combinations: default
      ## Instead of 'default', a list of specific desired combinations
      ## can be supplied. Every combination will obtain its own results directory
      ## (named "marker__forward...reverse")
      ## The primer combination format must be: "forward...reverse"
      # - ITS3-KYO2...ITS4
      # - fITS7...ITS4

#### Taxonomy assignment ####

# By default, every possible combination of databases and 
# assignment methods is used. This can be changed by modifying
# the 'taxonomy' option in the 'pipelines' definion (above)

# Definition of all taxonomic databases used by default
# (sources are configured in taxonomy.yaml).
# Optional filters allow to only keep reference sequences
# with a certain taxonomic rank defined.
# TODO: More filtering or trimming options could be added
